  <h1>Linguistic Evidence in the MICOP Community Needs Assessment   </h1>

<p>
In 20## Young et al reported on the results of a Needs Assessment at the Mixteco Community Organizing Project (MICOP).
The assessment was made through 1000 interviews.
</p>

<p>
The assessment provides the best available evidence as to the linguistic makeup of the MICOP immigrant community in California, since the interviewees reported their places of origin. The results of this interview are the best proxy we have for a linguistic survey at this time, since direct experience suggests that most MICOP community members speak some variant of Mixtec. 
</p>

<p>
(A further step might be to cross-correlate these numbers with census data on the percentage of inhabitants that speak an indigenous language in each municipality or distrito (@@ find reference).)
</p>

<h2>Geographical Ambiguities</h2>

<p>
The difference between town (<em>pueblo</em>), “district seat” (<em>cabecera</em>), district (<em>distrito</em>), and municipality (<em>municipio</em>) must 
be borne in mind when evaluating these numbers. Many interviewees referred to their home community by referring to the <em>distrito</em> which contained their home town. However, most <em>cabeceras</em> have the same name as that of the <em>distrito</em> of which they are the regional capital. Furthermore, <em>cabeceras</em> tend to be the largest urban conglomeration within the <em>distrito</em>, but urbanization is associated with <em>less</em> use of indigenous languages. 
</p>
<p>
Thus, a response of being “from” San Martín Peras (the most common response) is somewhat ambiguous, since many who responded thus may in fact hail from neighboring, smaller pueblos. Personal conversation with community members seems to suggest that many in the MICOP community seem to assume that the specific name is not terribly useful as a response, since the towns are so small. 
</p>
<p>
However, other interviewees <em>did</em> respond with a specific pueblo. The overall effect of this pattern does not diminish the overall utility of the survey, but it does mean that in those cases where a response reported a name which is synonymous with the <em>cabecera</em> as well as the <em>distrito</em>, it is probably best to assume that those responses may in fact be better thought of as referring to an unknown <em>pueblo</em> within the <em>distrito</em> rather than the <em>cabecera</em> itself.
</p>

<p>
This pattern raises another complication for any linguistic inferences to be made from these numbers: dialectal distributions do not correspond to political divisions. Thus, a speaker reporting a particular <em>distrito</em> may in fact speak a variant which is closer to those of an adjoining <em>distrito</em>
